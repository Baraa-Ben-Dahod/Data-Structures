# Data Structures – Technion (Course 234218)

This repository contains my solutions for the **Technion Data Structures 1 (234218)** course.  
It includes two homework projects ("wet" assignments):

- **wet1/** – Pirates and Ships (AVL trees, custom data structures).  
- **wet2/** – Pirate Fleets (Hash tables, union–find).  

Each folder contains its own `README.md` file with detailed explanations of the problem, 
the functionality of the implemented code, complexities, and lessons learned.

**Note:** The original homework PDFs with course staff details were intentionally removed.  
This repository only contains my implementations and explanations.
